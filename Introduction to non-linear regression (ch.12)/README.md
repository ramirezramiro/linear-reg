The excercises solved in this repository belong to the Chapter 12: Introduction to non-linear regression of "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 5th edition by MONTGOMERY, DOUGLAS C., PECK, ELIZABETH A., and VINING, G. GEOFFREY" (2013). 

This repository contains scripts in Python 3.10 to implement basic non-linear models given a specific csv dataset.

### Chapter 12: Introduction to non-linear regression :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

**12.7** Reconsider the regression models in Problem 12.6, parts a – e. Suppose the error terms in these models were multiplicative, not additive. Rework the problem under this new assumption regarding the error structure.

**12.8** Consider the following observations:

**a.** Fit the non-linear regression model

**b.** Test for significance of regression

**c.** Estimate the error variance

**d.** Test the hypotheses H0:θ1 = 0 and H0:θ2 = 0. Are both model parameters different from zero? If not, refit an appropriate model.

**e.** Analyze the residuals from this model. Discuss model adequacy.
