The excercises solved in this repository belong to the Chapter 8: Indicator Variables of "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 5th edition by MONTGOMERY, DOUGLAS C., PECK, ELIZABETH A., and VINING, G. GEOFFREY" (2013). 

This repository contains scripts in Python 3.10 to implement Indicator Variables given a specific csv dataset.

### Chapter 8: Indicator Variables :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

**8.4** Consider the automobile gasoline mileage data in [Table B.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Reg%20(ch.3)/data(ch.3)/table-b3.csv).

**a.** Build a linear regression model relating gasoline mileage y to engine displacement x1 and the type of transmission x11. Does the type of transmission significantly affect the mileage performance?

**b.** Modify the model developed in part a to include an interaction between engine displacement and the type of transmission. What conclusions can you draw about the effect of the type of transmission on gasoline mileage? Interpret the parameters in this model.
