# Polynomial Regression Models 

---

The excercises solved in this repository belong to the Chapter 7: Polynomial Regression Models of "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 5th edition by MONTGOMERY, DOUGLAS C., PECK, ELIZABETH A., and VINING, G. GEOFFREY" (2013). 

This repository contains scripts in Python 3.10 to implement Polynomial Regresion Models given a specific csv dataset.

### Chapter 7: Polynomial Regression Models :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

**7.2** A solid-fuel rocket propellant loses weight after it is produced. The following data are available:

[Table ch.7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Polynomial%20Regression%20Models%20(ch.7)/dataset/ch7-p2.csv).

**a.** Fit a second-order polynomial that expresses weight loss as a function of the number of months since production. 

**b.** Test for significance of regression.

**c.** Test the hypothesis ***H0:β2 = 0***. Comment on the need for the quadratic term in this model.

**d.** Are there any potential hazards in extrapolating with this model?

**7.3** Refer to Problem 7.2. Compute the residuals for the second-order model. Analyze the residuals and comment on the adequacy of the model.

**7.8** Consider the data in Problem 7.2.

**a.** Fit a second - order model to these data using orthogonal polynomials.

**b.** Suppose that we wish to investigate the addition of a third-order term to this model. Comment on the necessity of this additional term. Support your conclussions with an appropiate statistical analysis.
