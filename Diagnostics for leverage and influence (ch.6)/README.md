# Diagnostics for leverage and influence

---

The excercises solved in this repository belong to the Chapter 6: Diagnostics for leverage and influence of "Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, 5th edition by MONTGOMERY, DOUGLAS C., PECK, ELIZABETH A., and VINING, G. GEOFFREY" (2013). 

This repository contains scripts in Python 3.10 to implement Diagnostics for leverage and influence analysis given a specific csv dataset.

### Chapter 6: Diagnostics for leverage and influence :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

**6.2** Perform a thorough influence analysis of the property valuation data given
in Table B.4. Discuss your results. [Table B.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Reg%20(ch.3)/data(ch.3)/table-b3.csv).

**a.** Construct a normal probability plot of the residuals. Does there seem to
be any problem with the normality assumption?

**b.** Construct and interpret a plot of the residuals versus the predicted response.

**c.** Construct plots of the residuals versus each of the regressor variables. Do
these plots imply that the regressor is correctly specified?

**d.** Construct the partial regression plots for this model. Compare the plots
with the plots of residuals versus regressors from part c above. Discuss the
type of information provided by these plots.

**e.** Compute the studentized residuals and the R - student residuals for this
model. What information is conveyed by these scaled residuals?


**6.15** Consider the multiple regression model fit to the gasoline mileage data in [Problem 3.5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Reg%20(ch.3)/data(ch.3)/table-b3.csv)..
