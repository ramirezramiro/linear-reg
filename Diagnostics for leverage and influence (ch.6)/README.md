**6.2** Perform a thorough influence analysis of the property valuation data given
in [Table B.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Reg%20(ch.3)/data(ch.3)/table-b3.csv). Discuss your results. .


**6.15** [Table B.14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirezramiro/linear-reg/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Reg%20(ch.3)/data(ch.3)/table-b3.csv) contains data concerning the transient points of an electronic inverter. Fit a regression model to all 25 observations but only use x 1 − x 4 as the regressors. Investigate this model for influential observations and comment on your findings.
